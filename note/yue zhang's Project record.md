* Progress: Determined a direction (Class) and show a method to identify it.
* Problems: ECG diagnosis of pacing rhythm
* Plans: 1.  Plot ECG data give 30 examples. （For all leads）2. Decide my method to identify this

* Progress: 1. Plot ECG data give 30 examples. 2. analyze data
* Problems: 
  1. Some figure is hard to read
  2. misclassification
  3. mixed diseases.
* Plans: 
  1. find a template -- consider how to use code find/create it
  2. Try to find out  the interference of other diseases on PR -- maybe draw a picture of all mixed diseases to observe the pattern

* Progress: 1. read the paper and start to coding
* Problems: 
  1. debugging for the code that deal with baseline wander.
* Plans: 
  1. modify my background part
  2. try first my first model this week



18/06/2021

* Progress: 
  1. read a paper about wave detection.
  2. plot the figure of Tinv.
  3. have a basic understanding of Tinv.
* Problems: 
  1. Still need to understand the details of that paper.
  2. If I choose to reimplement the paper, the parameters should be readjusted.
  3. About Tinv.
* Plans: 
  1. Measure whether the algorithm is feasible
  2. Reimplement the paper
  3. need to read more paper (snow ball method)
