### Automatic spike detection in EEG by a two-stage procedure based on support vector machines

把波形分为疑似spike和非spike

* 预分类

1. low pass filter -> 平滑图像

   [python一维平滑滤波_SciPy - ECG信号的谱分析及数字滤波_二号猎人的博客-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_31234793/article/details/112367776)

   * 什么是低通滤波？
   * 设定一个频率点，当信号频率高于这个频率时不能通过，在数字信号中，这个频率点也就是[截止频率](https://baike.baidu.com/item/截止频率)，当频域高于这个截止频率时，则全部赋值为0。因为在这一处理过程中，让低频信号全部通过，所以称为低通滤波。
   * 如何去除基线漂移，工频干扰，肌电干扰？
   * 工频干扰 -- 带阻滤波器；基线漂移 -- 带通滤波器 & scipy.signal.detrend(): 消除线性干扰

2. 用AR（自回归模型）得到$\hat{x_n}$

3. 得到prediction error

4. 利用高斯5%的规律得到$\epsilon$，大于就是spike（和它的误分类），小于就不是

* 用新特征去创建新数据集的过程

1. The main peaks of the spike candidates are taken as the center of the window.

   【什么是main peaks？平均值吗】

2. 10 data points from left and 10 data points from right of the center are recalled by using the previously stored time indices from the original data.

   拿左边十个数据点和右边十个数据点

3. This procedure is repeated for 20; 30; 35; 40; 50; 60 and 70 data points from the right of the center, while 10 data points for left is 6xed (Fig. 6).

   右边拓展到20，30，40 ……

   处理完应该直接放SVM了





ECG信号处理：时间 -> 频率信号。通过观察这些频率信号，我们可以分析出这三种成份。



### A Crucial Wave Detection and Delineation Method for Twelve-Lead ECG Signals

* Preprocessing:

  electrode contact noise, powerline interference, baseline wander, electrode motion artifact, electrocardiography artifact, muscle artifacts, equipment noise and quantization noise

* Automatic diagnosis system:

  Identify the peak and boundary

  * Literature Review

    Delineate ECG signal.（Trad）

    1. QRS complex detection:  differentiating, squaring and integrating operation(Pan and Tompkins)  chirplet transform(Shaik)

    2. QRS & T: first derivative and wave morphology(Laguna)

    3. Detected the characteristic points in ECG signal by wavelet transform 

    4. multiscale morphological derivative (MMD) transform-based singularity detector(Sun)

    5. adaptive piece wise constant approximation (APCA) & piece wise derivative dynamic time warping (PDDTW) 

    ML:

    1. SVM

    2. KNN

    3. empirical mode decomposition (EMD) : The method decomposes time series signal into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which meet the sum of those functions is equal to the original signal:

       1.  Suppresse baseline wander and high-frequency noise by **removing selective high order IMFs** and **low order IMFs** and then detected QRS complex following a nonlinear transformation. 

          通过去除选择性高阶和低阶本征函数抑制基线漂移和高频噪声，然后进行非线性变换检测QRS复相。

       2. combined adaptive thresholding technique and EMD algorithm to delineate the QRS complex.

       * prob: How can I tell the figure is right or not?

* 其中Diff (x)为心电信号中位置x的微分值，Square(x)为微分信号中位置x的平方值，inter为平方信号中位置x的积分值。

* LOCATING R, Q, AND S WAVE

  ECGDer stands for the **derivative** signal of a wave, a beat, a lead or even twelve-lead signals.

  ECGDer表示一个波、一个拍、一个引线甚至十二个引线信号的导数信号

  ![image-20210618131827603](C:\Users\16778\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210618131827603.png)

  pos -- left side neg -- right side (left boundary & right boundary)

  ![image-20210618132413077](C:\Users\16778\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210618132413077.png)

  wrong boundary

  MADer might mark the right branch of S.

  Use 2 threshold to solve this problem， FPeak  the first peak forward in ECGDer where its absolute value is larger than a threshold Hhigh（low）

  ![image-20210618133658772](C:\Users\16778\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210618133658772.png)

  But sometimes QRS is inverted in aVR, so the left & right will be changed.

1. if aVR &  FPeak > 0: Pb(nearest peak before FPeak) - Fpeak find zero-crossing
2. if aVR & FPeak < 0: FPeak - Pa find zero-crossing
3. !if aVR &  FPeak > 0:  Fpeak - Pa find zero-crossing
4. !if aVR & FPeak < 0: Pb(nearest peak before FPeak) - Fpeak find zero-crossing

zero-crossing stands for P peak in raw signal. -- Guess it was the highest value for P wave.

The locations of R peaks in the same beat in other leads should be referred. -- pick the most **centralized** peak

Find R peak first, then search for the nearest peak forward and backward from the locations of R peaks in an interval of 80ms in the filtered signal. If not finding a peak in the time interval, consider they are nonexistent.

* P WAVE AND T WAVE LOCATION

  1. Locate beat. Use the average Q peak(12 leads) -> beat 
  2. wave signal window -- boundary & adaptive search window -- locate wave. So range of wave > range of search.
  3. ![image-20210618154525638](C:\Users\16778\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210618154525638.png)

  4. Psearch  & Tsearch offset range relative to bn. bn is the n peak. 

  5. Deal with AF, locate P T waves

  6. Get boundaries

​	An effective auxiliary segment should hold two conditions: 

1. at most one peak exists in the signal curve of auxiliary segment; 
2. the auxiliary  segment should be long enough to hold the feature point needed.

   Way to select onset and end

QRS onset: if Q wave exists, we search for the nearest peak backward from the location of Q wave in ECGDer signal and consider the peak location as the start point of the auxiliary segment in filtered signal; if Q wave is absent, we replace it with the location of R wave and do the same procedure.
QRS end: if S wave exists, we search for the nearest peak forward from the location of S wave in ECGDer signal and consider its location as the start point of the auxiliary segment in filtered signal; if S wave is lost, we replace it with the location R wave and do the same procedure.
• T onset and end: we search for nearest peaks forward and backward respectively from the location of T wave in ECGDer signal and consider them as the start points of the auxiliary segment of onset and end in second-filtered wave signal.
• P onset and end: it is same with T wave.
